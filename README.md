- **AI Agent Interface**: Natural language financial analysis with text-to-Cypher via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Entity & Generic Graphs**: Curated schemas for RoboLedger/RoboInvestor, plus custom schema support
- **Shared Repositories**: SEC XBRL filings knowledge graph for context mining and benchmarking
- **QuickBooks Integration**: Complete accounting synchronization with trial balance creation
- **DuckDB Staging System**: High-performance data validation and bulk ingestion pipeline
- **Dagster Orchestration**: Data pipeline orchestration for SEC filings, backups, billing, and scheduled jobs

## Quick Start

### Docker Development Environment

```bash
# Install uv (Python package and version manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Or on macOS with Homebrew: brew install uv

# Install just (command runner)
uv tool install rust-just
uv tool update-shell  # Adds ~/.local/bin to PATH (restart terminal after)

# Start all services (includes automatic migrations and seeds)
just start
```

This initializes the `.env` file and starts the complete RoboSystems stack with:

- Graph API with LadybugDB and DuckDB backends
- Dagster for data pipeline orchestration
- PostgreSQL for graph metadata, IAM and Dagster
- Valkey for caching, SSE messaging, and rate limiting
- Localstack for S3 and DynamoDB emulation

### Local Development

```bash
# Setup Python environment (uv automatically handles Python versions)
just init
```

## Examples & Demos

See RoboSystems in action with runnable demos that create graphs, load data, and execute queries with the `robosystems-client`:

```bash
just demo-sec               # Loads NVIDIA's SEC XBRL data via Dagster pipeline
just demo-accounting        # Creates chart of accounts with 6 months of transactions
just demo-custom-graph      # Builds custom graph schema with relationship networks
```

- **[SEC Demo](/examples/sec_demo)** - Real public company financials from SEC XBRL filings
- **[Accounting Demo](/examples/accounting_demo)** - Double-entry bookkeeping with trial balance and financial statements
- **[Custom Graph Demo](/examples/custom_graph_demo)** - Generic graph with custom schema and relationship patterns

Each demo has a corresponding [Wiki article](https://github.com/RoboFinSystems/robosystems/wiki) with detailed guides.

## Development Commands

### Testing

## Architecture

RoboSystems is built on a modern, scalable architecture with:

**Application Layer:**

- FastAPI REST API with versioned endpoints (`/v1/`)
- MCP Server for AI-powered graph database access
- Agent Interface for text-to-Cypher natural language queries
- Dagster for data pipeline orchestration and background jobs

**LadybugDB Graph Database:**

- Embedded columnar graph database purpose-built for financial analytics
- Native DuckDB integration for high-performance staging and ingestion
- Multi-tenant isolation with dedicated databases per entity
- Subgraph support for development workspaces and team collaboration
- Tiered infrastructure: Standard (multi-tenant), Large (dedicated r7g.large, 10 subgraphs), XLarge (dedicated r7g.xlarge, 25 subgraphs)

**Data Layer:**

- PostgreSQL for IAM, graph metadata, and Dagster
- Valkey for caching, SSE messaging, and rate limiting
- AWS S3 for data lake storage and static assets
- DynamoDB for instance/graph/volume registry

**Infrastructure:**

- ECS Fargate for API, Workers, and Dagster (ARM64/Graviton with Spot capacity)
- EC2 auto-scaling groups for LadybugDB writer clusters
- RDS PostgreSQL + ElastiCache Valkey
- CloudFormation infrastructure deployed via GitHub Actions (OIDC)

**For detailed architecture documentation, see the [Architecture Overview](https://github.com/RoboFinSystems/robosystems/wiki/Architecture-Overview) in the Wiki.**

## AI

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- **Financial Analysis**: Natural language queries across entity and benchmark data
- **Cross-Database Queries**: Compare entity data against SEC public data
- **Tools**: Rich toolkit for graph queries, schema introspection, fact discovery, and cross-database financial analysis
- **Handler Pool**: Managed MCP handler instances with resource limits

### Agent System

- Multi-agent architecture with intelligent routing
- Dynamic agent selection based on query context
- Parallel query processing with context-aware responses
- Extensible framework for custom domain expertise

### Credit System

- **Credit Value Anchor**: 1 credit = 1 GB/day of storage
- **Flexible Usage**: Use credits for AI operations OR storage overage—your choice
- **AI Operations**: Token-based billing for Anthropic Claude API calls via AWS Bedrock
- **Storage Overage**: Additional storage beyond tier allocation billed at 1 credit/GB/day
- **Sustainable Operations**: Credit-based model enables transparent cost tracking and predictable billing aligned with actual usage
